Gabe Cortez was the first to contact me from SWAT. He was very courteous and understanding of my needs. He was also very professional - his uniform and presentation were the top of the line. Thank you for all the time you put into making this process so easy. The crew that installed my beautiful, new roof were prompt, courteous &amp; VERY professional as well. When they were finished, all trash debris was gone - no nails were left in my yard."</q>

                          <p><q>I was watching the local news station after the bad weather came came through and I watched Andrew Dumas with SWAT Contracting on a featured story about how to hire a trustworthy and legitimate contractor. I have been watching this local news station for years now and I know if they trust SWAT Contracting enough to do a story with them then, that is who I need to use. I emailed them immediately and they showed up to my home that same day. They were instrumental in working with my insurance company directly to get my property restored to it's original condition. These guys are the best. I will definitely continue to refer SWAT Contracting to all my family and friends.</q>

I met you along with several of your crew and sales team & everyone proved that they had my best interest at heart. All of you were professional & very kind. The fact that the younger ones on your staff called me Sir was impressive. Young people don't seem to do that anymore. Although my home is somewhat small, each of you treated it as if it were a mansion. Again, thank you very much for all that you did to take care of my home.</q>
